## RAIbbit Hole Core

RAIbbit Hole Core is the V2 contracts of the NFT project [Galaxy Frens](https://twitter.com/RaibbitHole). The project has two main contracts: GalaxyFrens.sol and RAIbbitHoleTicket.sol. GalaxyFrens.sol is the main ERC721 of the project, and RAIbbitHoleTicket.sol is the additional token booster of the project. RaibbitHoleMission.sol is still WIP, where people can stake their ERC721 for extra $BFF ERC20 token rewards.


Originally RAIbbitHoleTicket is used as the ERC1155 to redeem the GalaxyFrens, so there is some additional design for burning and redeeming.
