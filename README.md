## RAIbbit Hole Core

RAIbbit Hole Core is the V2 contracts of the NFT project [Galaxy Frens](https://twitter.com/RaibbitHole). There are 2 main contracts in the project, GalaxyFrens.sol and RAIbbitHoleTicket.sol. GalaxyFrens.sol is the main ERC721 of the project, and RAIbbitHoleTicket.sol is the additional token booster of the project. 


Originally RAIbbitHoleTicket is used as the ERC1155 to redeem the GalaxyFrens so there are some additional design for burning and redeeming.
